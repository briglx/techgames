            <h3>History of the Games</h3>
            <p>
                The Avnet Tech Games (ATG) was started in 2006 as a partnership between Avnet Inc. and the Maricopa County Community College District
                in Arizona. The competition was created to help bridge the gap between college curriculum and high tech industry standards. Subsequently, the Avnet Tech Games was opened to all Arizona college students and then to college students nationwide through
                a virtual game competition.
            </p>
            <p>
                By providing students with an opportunity to apply what they learn in school to real-world scenarios, while giving them a chance to earn scholarships, the annual ATG competition encourages their dreams, and also connects them with professionals who can help make their dreams a reality.
                Today the competition is open to Arizona college students, as well as to students nationwide through our virtual games. Competitive events are developed to challenge students in computer science, engineering, IT, business and environmental science disciplines.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since its inception, more than 2,600 students and 100 faculty
                members from 85 colleges have participated in the Avnet Tech
                Games. Nearly $300,000 has been awarded in student scholarships and faculty honorariums.
            </p>
            <h3>How Your Students Benefit</h3>
            <p>
                Thousands of students will graduate and apply for the same jobs, but the ones who get the best jobs have one thing in common: experience outside the classroom. Adding the Avnet Tech Games to your resume can be the difference that can land you the job that will launch your career.
